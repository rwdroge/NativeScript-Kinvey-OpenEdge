### Kinvey integration
The templates uses the [{N} Kinvey plugin](https://github.com/Kinvey/nativescript-sdk). The initialization is done before the app starts in the `/app.js` file. The initialization script is located at `/shared/kinvey.common.js`.

### Styling
This template is set up to use SASS for styling. All classes used are based on the {N} core theme â€“ consult the [documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/theme.html#theme) to understand how to customize it. Check it out to see what classes you can use on which component.

It has 4 global style files that are located at the root of the app folder:
- `_app-variables.scss` - holds the global SASS variables that are imported on each component's styles.
- `app.scss` - the global common style sheet. These style rules are applied to both Android and iOS.
- `platform.android.scss` - the global Android style sheet. These style rules are applied to Android only.
- `platform.ios.scss` - the global iOS style sheet. These style rules are applied to iOS only.

Each component has 3 style files located in its folder:
- `_page-name.scss` - the component common style sheet. These style rules are applied to both Android and iOS.
- `page-name.android.scss` - the component Android style sheet. These style rules are applied to Android only.
